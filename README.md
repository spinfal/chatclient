# this version is using <a href="https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server#run-server" target="_blank">peerjs'</a> open public hosting.
<p>the version that i have linked in the 'about' section is using my own server, you can alternatively host your own server by heading over to <a href="https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server" target="_blank">their source repo</a> and following their steps. since this is using their open public hosting, expect some downtimes in performance.</p>

<br>this repo is only receiving 'safe' versions/features that im implementing. if you wish to use the most definite up-to-date version, use the link to your right
## peer.js public chat client
